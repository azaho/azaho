<p>
I lived my whole life in Ukraine. Then, in Fall 2021, I transferred to MIT. It was my first time in
America. Immediately, I started taking full advantage of opportunities MIT gave me to grow
professionally and change the world: publishing research papers, flying around the world to
intern, teach, and collaborate.
</p>
<p>
Just a few months later, Russia invaded Ukraine. A new era of havoc began.
</p>
<p>
My former classmates – bright, competent, fast-thinking Ukrainians – were suddenly only trying
to survive. They faced risks and dangers from Russian attacks daily. The war robbed them of
the kinds of opportunities I was enjoying.
</p>
<p>
Frankly, this disparity initiated a conflict inside me. It was unjust. I decided to take action.
</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>
Brilliant Ukrainians must have the same opportunities to improve their country and the world as
me. Since I was at MIT, I decided to bring MIT to Ukraine. This is how Ukraine Leadership &
Technology Academy (ULTA) began.
</p>
<p>
I developed this program to activate students' creativity, create a north star of excellence for
them to strive for, and empower them to rebuild Ukraine after the war.
</p>
<p>
Initially, ULTA seemed like another unrealistic dream. Despite having no resources or
connections, no team, and no well-trodden path, I pushed forward, driven by the conviction that
it was the right thing to do.
</p>
<p>
I submitted multiple rounds of proposals, inspired people to join my team, led endless zoom
meetings, and a dedicated research project. I went from struggling over choosing the program
name, to planning the logistics of a summer program abroad, to recruiting MIT students, and
running a selection process in Ukraine with 720 applications for 20 places.
</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>
On the first day of ULTA I was meeting my mentors and students at the Barcelona airport,
thinking to myself, "Wow, they really all came here." MIT mentors trusted my work enough to fly
halfway around the world for it; parents of the young students sent their kids so far away from
home.
</p>
<p>
I quickly learned the weight of being a respected authority figure.
</p>
<p>
One student's parents called in the midst of uncertainty about how to ensure a bright future for
the student, and shield their child from war. In a heartfelt letter, this student asked for help:
circumstances forced him to pick between studying in the USA and representing Ukraine at the
International Astronomy Olympiad.
</p>
<p>
When preparing for pivotal next steps in their lives, students relied on my recommendation
letters. When making life-defining decisions, students and their parents seeked my guidance.
</p>
<p>
I saw this enormous added responsibility as an opportunity. It challenged me to embody the very
principles I advocated: staying true to one's values without a fault, living courageously, and
embracing risks. In the past, this was a mere aspiration. Now, a necessity: to lead by example.
</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>
And this deal that I made with myself has carried me through the darkest moments of this
program and my life.
</p>
<p>
In the second half of the program, our students initiated hands-on projects for rebuilding
Ukraine. Naturally, they set the most ambitious goals. One team aimed to revolutionize
Ukraine's hackathon culture by building an innovative platform and organizing its first in-person
hackathon – all within only two months.
</p>
<p>
Our sponsors, a Ukrainian education company, were skeptical. They didn't believe that our
students, high schoolers with no prior experience, could succeed. Breaking our contract, the
executives decided to withdraw their support. They explicitly wrote to me that they saw no point
in continuing to fund ULTA.
</p>
<p>
I thought back to why I started this program: to foster ambition and make a real difference in
Ukraine. These kids were trying to do exactly that. Even without being certain of success, even
as ULTA lost its sponsor, my values gave me the courage to support the students. I told them,
"Keep going. Your ambition, your drive to help Ukraine – that's exactly what we're here for. Don't
let anyone tell you it's impossible."
</p>
<p>
We succeeded. I negotiated a future for ULTA, and in the meantime, proudly attended the first
hackathon organized by my students. A group of driven high school students accomplished
what seemed impossible to seasoned professionals. Witnessing their success, our sponsors
had a change of heart. They not only recognized the team's achievement but also provided a
space for them to run the hackathon.
</p>
<p>
Thus I learned about the importance of integrity even in the face of doubt and adversity. Now, I
know: the unyielding belief in doing what's right leads to remarkable outcomes, despite
skepticism of others.
