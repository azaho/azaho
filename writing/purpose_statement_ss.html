I'll tell you about the happiest moment of my research career.
</p>
<p>
At MIT, I spent years studying computations that run in the brain. I took almost every class in the
department, engaged deeply with the research community, and contributed to seven different
labs across four continents. In my own research, I examined mechanisms employed by
computational models of the brain performing cognitive tasks, and compared them to signals
coming from trained monkeys. Currently, we know so little about how the brain works and how
to fix it, because there is simply no access to it. All the memories, reactions and feelings are
locked up inside the skull.
</p>
<p>
One day, I developed a new tool to compare artificial intelligence models to neural data coming
from live brains. It showed me what strategy the monkey brain used to solve a specific task: one
of the many AI model hypotheses came closest to the brain data. I realized that the monkey was
not looking at the task the same way as the human experimenters. Instead of the designed four
diagonals as task conditions, it only saw two, and not the ones that the experimenters intended.
From the point of view of a human, it was a puzzling strategy. However, for the monkey brain
this made complete sense: the actions required to receive the reward only included
remembering those two conditions, as opposed to all possible four. This understanding allowed
me to see the world from the perspective of that monkey's brain, which explained its odd
behavior in the task and suggested ways to change it.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly, I opened a new route for understanding human intelligence: from the standpoint of AI.
Just as in the Age of Exploration improving the navigation system let sailors venture across vast
oceans and discover new continents, large AI models are now like a ship to navigate and
explore the human mind.
</p>
<p>
All world-defining decisions – whether the most noble and selfless, or most horrific – are made
by people. Comprehending how they function on a mechanical level is thus a wonderful tool.
Just as dopamine studies are extensively used in marketing and social media design, I want
leaders to understand the crucial mechanistic role of dopamine in signaling differences between
expected and achieved rewards. For negotiators, AI-provided insights will enable maintaining a
crisp model of the other's mind, and using it to improve communication.
</p>
<p>
I want the next generation of world leaders to scientifically understand human intelligence.
Through further research, I plan to develop AI-powered tools for decoding human cognitive
processes. I will advocate for evidence-based policies informed by AI-driven insights into human
behavior. I plan to establish a school for future leaders focused on AI and human cognition. In
particular, in my home country Ukraine, where I'm already educating young leaders, I'd like to
take the next step: to inform their leadership through breakthroughs in AI and neuroscience.
This way, I hope to contribute to a future with more informed, empathetic, and effective global
decision-making.
